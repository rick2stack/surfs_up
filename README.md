## Overview Of Analysis:
For this module we are opening a surf shop in Hawaii.  Investors are worried about the weather and have requested to do a bit more analysis on the weather.  
With hawaii.sqlite database we will analyze both the weather in June and in December for the years 2010-2017.  

## Results: 

They are three main details between June and December temperature. 

First, the mean temperature for December (71F) is lower than June (74f).  However, they are both still within a very mild tempeture range.

Second, the minimum and maximum temperatures are also very similar.  December does have a lower minimum tempeture (56F) than June (64F) but both max temperatures are essentially the same. 

Lastly, both the standard deviation in December and June are essentially the same.  Temperatures truely just have a 3-4 degree shift as shown in the 25%, 50%, and 75% percentiles.   

## Summary 

As describe above, the temperature for Hawaii is very consistent year-round, even at the two most polar distinct months. Making Hawaii good location for beach activities year-round.   A further analysis on precipitation data for June (.02" per day) show that the 50% percitile there is little to no rainfall. December does have more heavier rain (.03" per day) in the 50% percentile. However, upon further analysis the days with no rain in June and december are very comparible for the 2010-2017 data.
